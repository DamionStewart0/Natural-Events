### MVP/PostMVP
- Project will be built using HTML CSS and javascript.
- Project will be utilising a HTTP client called Axios to access information from the api
- App will be optimize for but desktop and mobile viewports

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Consume the Nasa api for current data 
- Allow user to choose any location worldwide
- Display response from api to screen

#### PostMVP  
- Add and event lister to hide text informatioon from api response
- Use local storage to save user locations

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Dec 21| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|Dec 21| Project Approval | Incomplete
|Dec 22| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Dec 23| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Jan 4| MVP | Incomplete
|Jan 5| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day. Students usally put in around 40+ hours into their project 1.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Creating Structure | H | 6hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Working with API | H | 6hrs| hrs | hrs |
| Adding Eventlister| H |  3hrs|  hrs | hrs|
| Styling application|H | 2hrs| hrs| hrs|
| Total | H | 45hrs| hrs | hrs |
